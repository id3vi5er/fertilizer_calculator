# Plant Fertilizer Calculator

## Description

Plant Fertilizer Calculator is a Python application designed to help users manage plant fertilization schedules and calculate appropriate nutrient dosages. It allows users to store data for individual plants, track their growth stages, and determine fertilizer amounts based on pre-defined schedules and water quantities. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

It reads plant data from `pflanzendaten.csv` and fertilization schedules/EC target values from `fertilizer_config.json`.

## Features

*   **Plant Data Management:**
    *   Store and manage plant details: name, germination date, genetics, and custom notes.
    *   Automatically calculate the current growth week of a plant.
    *   Add new plants and delete existing ones.
*   **Fertilizer Calculation:**
    *   Load customizable fertilizer schedules from `fertilizer_config.json`. Each fertilizer can have different dosage recommendations per week.
    *   Load target Electrical Conductivity (EC) values for each growth week from `fertilizer_config.json`.
    *   Calculate the required fertilizer amount (in ml) based on the plant's current week, the desired water amount, and selected fertilizer types.
    *   Display the target EC value for the plant's current week.
*   **EC Helper Tool:**
    *   Assists in adjusting the nutrient solution to a specific target EC value.
    *   Calculates the amount of growth or bloom fertilizer needed to reach the target EC based on the current EC of the water and the total water volume.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   GUI built with Tkinter for easy interaction.
    *   Dropdown menus for plant selection.
    *   Input fields for water amount.
    *   Checkboxes to select multiple fertilizers for calculation.
    *   A dedicated section for plant-specific notes.

## File Structure

*   `fertilizers_v2.py`: Main Python script for the application (contains the GUI and logic).
*   `pflanzendaten.csv`: CSV file storing data for each plant (Name, Germination Date, Genetics, Info).
*   `fertilizer_config.json`: JSON file containing:
    *   `fertilizer_data`: Schedules for different fertilizers (dosage per week).
    *   `ec_values`: Target EC values (in mS/cm) per growth week.
*   `fertilizers.ico`: Icon file for the application.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `build/`, `dist/`: Directories typically generated by PyInstaller during the executable creation process.
*   `*.spec`: PyInstaller specification files for building executables.

## Setup and Running the Application

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x installed on your system.
    *   Tkinter library (usually included with standard Python installations).

2.  **Configuration:**
    *   **Plant Data (`pflanzendaten.csv`):**
        *   If this file doesn't exist, the application will create it with a header row.
        *   You can add plants through the application's UI ("Neue Pflanze anlegen" button).
        *   The CSV columns are: `Pflanzenname,Keimdatum,Genetik,Infos`.
    *   **Fertilizer Schedules (`fertilizer_config.json`):**
        *   This file is crucial for the application to function correctly.
        *   It must contain `fertilizer_data` (listing various fertilizers and their dosage in ml/L per week) and `ec_values` (target EC in mS/cm per week).
        *   The application expects weeks as integer keys (e.g., "1", "2") and dosages/EC values as numbers.
        *   Example structure:
            ```json
            {
              "fertilizer_data": {
                "MyGrowthBooster": {"1": 0.5, "2": 1.0, "3": 1.5},
                "MyBloomEnhancer": {"8": 1.0, "9": 2.0}
              },
              "ec_values": {
                "1": 0.4, "2": 0.6, "3": 0.8, "8": 1.2, "9": 1.4
              }
            }
            ```

3.  **Running the Script:**
    *   Navigate to the directory containing `fertilizers_v2.py`.
    *   Run the script from your terminal:
        ```bash
        python fertilizers_v2.py
        ```

    *   The application window should open. If `fertilizer_config.json` is missing or malformed, an error message will be displayed, and the application will likely close.

## Future Enhancements (Feature Ideas)

1.  **Graphical Data Visualization:**
    *   Implement charts to visualize plant growth (if height/other metrics are tracked) and fertilization history (amounts applied, EC values over time). This would provide users with a clearer understanding of trends and plant development.

2.  **Advanced Configuration Options & Customization:**
    *   Allow users to define custom fertilizer types and their specific EC contribution factors directly within the application's UI or a dedicated settings panel.
    *   Enable the creation and management of multiple, named fertilization schemes (e.g., "Aggressive Bloom," "Mild Veg") that users can switch between.
    *   Add an option to specify different EC target values for various growth mediums (e.g., soil, coco, hydroponics).

3.  **Reminder/Logging System:**
    *   Introduce a system for logging past fertilization events (date, amounts, observations).
    *   Allow users to set reminders for future fertilizations based on their schedules or customizable intervals, helping maintain consistency.
